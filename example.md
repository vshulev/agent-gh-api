>>> What are the core resources exposed by the API?

I apologize, but I couldn't find any specific information about the core resources exposed by the API in the loaded OpenAPI specification. Could you 
please provide more details about the API you are referring to?

>>> How do I authenticate my requests?

I apologize for the confusion, but I couldn't find any specific information about how to authenticate requests in the loaded OpenAPI specification. To 
determine how to authenticate your requests, please refer to the API documentation or contact the API provider for more information on the authentication
methods supported by the API.

>>> How can I create a new repository via the API? Provide a sample request/response.

Here is a sample request to create a new repository for the authenticated user:

**Request:**
```
POST /user/repos
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}

{
  "name": "my-new-repo",
  "description": "This is a new repository created via the API",
  "private": false
}
```

**Response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123456789,
  "name": "my-new-repo",
  "description": "This is a new repository created via the API",
  "private": false,
  "owner": {
    "login": "my-username",
    "id": 987654321,
    "type": "User"
  },
  "html_url": "https://github.com/my-username/my-new-repo",
  "created_at": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

In the above example, the request is made to the `/user/repos` endpoint with the necessary parameters in the request body. The response contains the 
details of the newly created repository, including its ID, name, description, visibility (private or public), owner information, URL, and creation/update
timestamps.

Please note that the actual endpoint and request/response structure may vary depending on the API you are using. Make sure to refer to the API 
documentation for the specific details and requirements.

>>> What parameters does the search API accept?

Here are the parameters accepted by the search API:

1. `q` (required): This parameter contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers. It allows you to specify the search query to filter the results.

The `q` parameter supports various qualifiers that allow you to refine your search. Some common qualifiers include:

- `in`: Limits the search to a specific area, such as `in:file` to search only in file contents or `in:title` to search only in issue titles.
- `repo`: Limits the search to a specific repository or repositories. For example, `repo:username/repo-name` or `repo:org-name/repo-name`.
- `user`: Limits the search to a specific user or organization. For example, `user:username` or `user:org-name`.
- `language`: Limits the search to repositories that are written in a specific programming language. For example, `language:python`.
- `stars`: Filters repositories based on the number of stars. For example, `stars:>1000` to search for repositories with more than 1000 stars.

These are just a few examples of the qualifiers that can be used with the `q` parameter. The full list of qualifiers and their usage can be found in the 
API documentation for the specific search API you are using.

Please note that the actual parameters and their usage may vary depending on the API you are using. Make sure to refer to the API documentation for the 
specific details and requirements.
